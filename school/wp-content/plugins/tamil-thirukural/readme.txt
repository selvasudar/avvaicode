A simple widget to display a random Tamil Thirukural and its explanation.

== Description ==

The Thirukkural is a classic Tamil text in the form of couplets dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual. This WordPress plugin offers a widget to display a random Thirukural in Tamil. The widget also displays chapter, section and explanations by three different scholars(Dr. Mu.Karunanidhi, Dr. Mu.Varadhrajan, Kalaimamani Solomon Pappaiah) for each kural. You could choose which explanation to be shown from the widget options. More customization options coming soon!.
